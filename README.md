🎮 Snake Water Gun Game in Python! Learn the Basics of Game Development 🐍💧🔫

I recently developed a Python script for the classic game Snake Water Gun, also known as Rock Paper Scissors with a twist! This project is not just about fun but also serves as a great introduction to fundamental programming concepts like conditional statements and random number generation.

How the Game Works:
Setup: The game involves you (the player) and the computer (as the opponent).
Choices:
You can choose:
0 for Snake 🐍
1 for Water 💧
2 for Gun 🔫
The computer randomly selects one of these options as well.
Outcome Determination:
Snake drinks Water (Snake wins)
Water extinguishes Gun (Water wins)
Gun shoots Snake (Gun wins)
If both choose the same item, it's a draw.
